### max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]

According to the [anwser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51445846/elasticsearch-max-virtual-memory-areas-vm-max-map-count-65530-is-too-low-inc) from Stack Overflow , we should use `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`.If we set memory limit in `~/.wslconfig`, however, all limits in `~/.wslconfig` setting will lose their function once we use the command. That is CPU and Memory will consume a lot.

We can just remove the `memory` limit in  `~/.wslconfig` and use  `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`. However, we should type the command once we restart wsl and the way of adding `vm.max_map_count=262144`  to  `/etc/sysctl.conf` not work.

Here is the solution I found as I post it in [vm.max_map_count in docker-desktop distro for WSL2](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5202#issuecomment-813183731) #5202

```docker-compose
version: '2.2'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:6.8.14
    privileged: true
    user: root
    command:
      - /bin/bash
      - -c
      - |
        sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144 &&
        su elasticsearch -c bin/elasticsearch
    container_name: elasticsearch
```

As you can see in the picture below, the `max_map_count` number change after we running the docker compose.

![It works fine after using that code](https://i.imgur.com/3XZgziS.png)

And the CPU usage also controls fine.

I googled and found a question in a similar situation to mine.
